### Hi there, I'm Brieuc Dubois ðŸ‘‹

#### Glad to see you here!

I am a master student in computer science at [University of Louvain](https://github.com/uclouvain) in Belgium. I love programming and learning new things mainly to use them to improve my life and that of my mates. I attach a great importance to use and develop open source softwares.

#### Some personal stuffs:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many pretty cool things as I love to work on many projects at the time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a ton of things such as [devOps](https://git.bhasher.com/Bhasher/homelab), [go/svelte](https://git.bhasher.com/Bhasher/focus) and [Nix](https://github.com/BhasherBEL/dotfiles-nix).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on stuffs I use, to improve them for myself and for any other user, by example [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy) and [Focalbard](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything, I will try to answer and if I don't have enough knowledge, I will learn it.
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is by pull request one of my repos ðŸ˜„.
