### Hi there, I'm Brieuc Dubois 👋

#### Glad to see you here! ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=BhasherBEL)

I am a bachelor student in computer science at [University of Louvain](https://github.com/uclouvain) in Belgium. I love programming and learning new things mainly to use them to improve my life and that of my mates.

#### Some personal stuffs:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on many pretty cool things as I love to work on many projects at the time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a ton of new things such as [flutter](https://github.com/BhasherBEL/MobileInpact), [competitive programming](https://github.com/BhasherBEL/competitive-programming) and [devOps](https://github.com/BhasherBEL/homelab).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on stuffs I use, to improve them for myself and for any other user, by example [Finamp](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp) and [openScale](https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale).
- 💬 Ask me anything, I will try to answer and if I don't have enough knowledge, I will learn it.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by pull request one of my repos 😄.
